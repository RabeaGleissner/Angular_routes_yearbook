# Angular yearbook

The task was to create a one page app which introduces our Web Development Immersive course cohort, the projects that we created, the technology we learnt and the wonderful instructional team who put up with us.

I started working on this project using our private General Assembly homework Github repo, hence the lack of commit history.

## Technology used

I just started learning Angular and used this yearbook page to practise using Angular directives and routing. All CSS styling is my own (no frameworks used). 

## How to run it
  `cd angular-routes-yearbook`

Start a simple python server

  `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888`
  
 `open http://localhost:8888`
